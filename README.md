## Overview

### Brief

- **Group work**,
- **2 day timeframe**,
- Build a **Front-End application**, primarily with **React JS**,
- Use of **External APIs**,
- Be **deployed online** so it's **publicly accessible**,

Working in a group of 3, we created Director Dictator, a Movie Generator App which generates a random movie from which users can choose to find out more about or move onto the next choice.

The concept is to help those that have run out of movie ideas to choose something less conventional as well as to limit the total of possible choices for those users who are indecisive. The movies have been fetched from an external API database, OMDB.

## Technologies

- ReactJS,
- HTML5,
- SCSS (with Bulma framework),
- Github,
- Insomnia (Back-End Testing),

## External APIs

This application uses an external API, in order to enjoy the full experience of this application, please use the deployed version here ([https://directordictator.netlify.app/](https://directordictator.netlify.app/)) or to run it locally, you will need to sign up for an API key from the following link:

- [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (Movie database),

## Planning

- RESTful Routes for Back-end,

    ![Insomnia Screenshot](/ReadmeResources/Insomnia.png)

- Triple-Coding for main logic involved in making a request and presenting the response from the external movie API, OMDB,
- Delegation of remaining tasks depending on member's comfortability in certain areas (i.e. SCSS, Home page, 404 page etc),
- Use of the 'Live Share' extension on VSCode text editor to simultaneously work remotely on the same project files and regular Git Commits,

### MVP

- Home page with title,
- Movie 'Show' page which presents a random movie to the user obtained from a HTTP Get Request made to the OMDB API,
- Functionality to 'pass' the movie presented to the user which in turn, initiates another 'Request-Response' cycle to present a new random movie to the user,
- A '404' error page which redirects users who have entered an incorrect url,

## Getting Started

As highlighted earlier, in order to enjoy the full experience of the application, it is recommended to use the deployed version at [https://directordictator.netlify.app/](https://directordictator.netlify.app/). If you wish to run it locally, you will need to follow the following steps:

- Fork or Clone the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/tams2429/GA-Project-2-MovieAPI](https://github.com/tams2429/GA-Project-2-MovieAPI)),
- Run `yarn` to install all the dependencies,
- `yarn start` to start the development server for the whole application,

## Wins

A major win for this project was successfully manipulating the 'Response' data sent back from the OMDB API, so that only Movies were presented back to the User. As the 'Request' had only allowed for a general query to be made, we had to filter out those that were not movies (i.e. TV shows etc). This is demonstrated in the 'getRandomMovie' function below.

```jsx
getRandomMovie = async () => {
    if (!this.state.moviesLeft) {
      this.props.history.push('/problempage')
      return
    }
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9000000)
    this.setState( { movie: null } )
    try {
      const res = await getMovie('tt' + randomIndex)

      if (res.data.Response === 'True' && res.data.Type === 'movie' && res.data.Poster !== 'N/A') {
        const moviesLeft = this.state.moviesLeft - 1
        return this.setState( { movie: res.data, moviesLeft } )
      }
      return this.getRandomMovie()
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('The error is', error)
    }
  }
```

## Challenges

One of the challenges of this project was the delegation of work since the assigned scope was meant to be for teams of 2 whereas we were a group of 3. As a result, instead of the traditional 'Pair-Coding' we did it as a 3, where we found a useful VSCode extension, 'Liveshare', which allowed all of us to share the same screen given the remote working conditions during the Lockdown.

## Future Work

### Bugs

- Sound file does not play on page load on 'Home.js' page,

### Planned features/extensions

- Additional sounds to play after every choice a user makes on the 'Movie.js' page,
- Trailer video to be added to each movie card if available,

## Credits

I would like to thank my fellow team members, Dan Irons & Dan Price, without whom, this project would not be as successful and complete as it is given the tight timeframe.
